            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE Linnen Drapers Answer To that Part of Mr. <hi>

                  </gap>ARY</hi> his Essay on Trade, That Concerns <hi>The East India Trade.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THAT that Trade is advantageous to <hi>England,</hi> which exports on Product, imports Commodities to be manufactured, furnisheth us with Necessaries for Forreign Trade, and increaseth Seamen, is a Truth beyond Contradiction.</p>
            <p>But that all Trade is to be abandoned, that doth not answer all these Ends, or that the Interest of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> in respect to Trade, and the advantage made thereby, is not the same, is that which must be considered.</p>
            <p>It is also true, particular persons may improve their Estates by Buying and Selling, and the Nation be never the Richer; this holds good in all Inland Trade and our Home Consumption: but how this can be properly applied to any Forreign Trade, or particularly to that of the <hi>East Indies,</hi> which in some degree answers all the fore-mentioned Advantages of Trade to <hi>England,</hi> is that our Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sayer is to make out.</p>
            <p>To allow (what he saith is allowed) that the Product and Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facture of the Kingdom, is the least part of what the <hi>East India</hi> Company export to <hi>India,</hi> is his allowing that it is a part of that Exportation (and we may inform him it doth appear upon Oath, that <hi>Communibus Annis,</hi> ever since the Company's New Charter, they have Exported above a Hundred thousand Pounds worth of Cloth yearly, and that Gold and Silver is but another part. He forgot to add, that every Ship set to Sea on an <hi>East India</hi> Voyage, cost Ten thousand Pounds at least, one with the other; that what of this is not laid out in Beef, Pork, Pease, Bisket, and the Produce of the Kingdom, is expended about the Ship, her Rigging, in la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and incouraging Useful Arts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> altogether as much to the Kingdoms advantage as the other.</p>
            <p>That these Ships are as useful to the Government, upon any Emergency, as to Trade, and that it is the Interest of the Nation to incourage such Ships.</p>
            <pb n="2" facs="tcp:186339:2"/>
            <p>The returns of what is Exported to the <hi>East-Indies,</hi> being Grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be in Commodities necessary, as well for Home expence as Exportation (Callicoes and wrought Silks excepted) if we make appear the use of Callicoes and Wrought Silks doth not prejudice, but increase the Sale of Woollen Manufactures: We hope the Essayer will see reason why the Wearing of them should not be Prohibited, and that he will not Petition the Parliament against the use of them in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We desire he would not expect, we should follow him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Germany</hi> to plead their Cause against <hi>Sletias</hi> Linnens. We will indeavour to convince him, that the improvement of the Woollen Manufactures in <hi>Germany</hi> was not occasioned by the Importation and use of Callicoes in <hi>England;</hi> that Manufacture being set on foot before the Fire of <hi>London,</hi> when the <hi>East-India</hi> Trade was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing so considerable, and Callicoes much dearer then they have been since; and that the cheapness of Callicoes may be a means (if any thing can) to put them by that improvement: This is all he may expect from us on that Head.</p>
            <p>The present War, as we understand, hath put a stop to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress of the Woollen Manufacture in <hi>Germany.</hi> If <hi>England</hi> can af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford ours so cheap, that they may not have incouragement to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin it again, that Controversie is at an end. Plenty of Callicoes is a certain Expedient to moderate the price of all Commodities, and thereby preserves and increases the Forreign Trade (which is the profitable Trade of <hi>England</hi>) and Regulate the Home. To Prohibit the use, is to Prohibit the Importation, and destroy all; so that the Germans will return again to their making of Wool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len, not because they cannot find Vent for their Linnen, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause not being supplied at Reasonable Rates from us; returning to the Woollen is more to their advantage.</p>
            <p>We will not Reflect on our Essayers Ingenious Descants on the Extravagances of the Age, his good Advice to the Nobility and Gentry, nor his Proposals to the Government; we wish him good Success in it. Our difference with him is upon his mistaken Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ims, That the way to improve the English, is to Prohibit the use of Forreign Manufactures; and that to inrich the Kingdom, is to confine its Growth to our own Dominions; not considering that if we prohibit the use of the Commodities of other Nations, they may, and in all probability will do the same by ours; and that this will prejudice our Forreign Trade, and that the very Prohibition is insensibly laying a Tax on the Nation, to make us pay the more for what we use, and abridging the King of so much Custom which the Subject must make good.</p>
            <p>We say it is the Interest of the Kingdom, that the Home Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption should be little, of a Cheap and Forreign Growth, and that our own Manufactures should be spent abroad and at the highest Market; because by all that is spent at home, one loseth what another gets, the Nation is not the richer. But a Forreign
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:186339:2"/> Consumption is clear profit, adds ro the heap, without taking from the Inhabitant.</p>
            <p>The Trade of any Nation is its Riches, how it comes to pass that our Essayer hath made Trade of less advantage to <hi>England</hi> than <hi>Holland,</hi> is the next thing to be inquired into.</p>
            <p>He tells us the Dutch have little Land, are rather maintained by Buying and Selling, then Manufacturing; but <hi>England</hi> is a large Spot of Ground, hath a great Product of its own, gets by the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment of its People; and concludes its the Wisdom of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment to Regulate Forreign Trade by Methods that may make it useful in Promoting our own Manufactures.</p>
            <p>True it is <hi>England</hi> hath more Land than <hi>Holland,</hi> and a greater Product of its own; but this is no Argument that it is not the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest of <hi>England</hi> as well as <hi>Holland,</hi> to incourage and promote Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce. We say we are an Island better accommodated to and more immediately depending on Trade (especially Forreign Trade) than <hi>Holland</hi> it self. Our Ships are our Walls, our Trade our Riches. We are situated by Nature to be the Mart of <hi>Europe,</hi> it is the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint upon us (because <hi>England</hi> is not a Free Port) that all Trade doth not Center here. To prohibit the use of Forreign Manufa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures, were still to do us farther mischief; this would render our Shipping useless and lessen Navigation: and in our Naval Force lies not only the Welfare, but the very Being of Our Nation.</p>
            <p>It is the undoubted Interest of <hi>England</hi> to incourage our own Manufactures, and in proportion to their usefulness and benefit, such should be their incouragement. We differ with the Essayer on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly about the method.</p>
            <p>We conclude from daily experience it can be done by no Law so effectually, as by leaving Trade free and sheltering it against all Prohibitions. He from an evil and covetous Principle, like the Dog in the Fable, would catch at the shadow and lose the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance.</p>
            <p>The Manufactures in <hi>Holland,</hi> in proportion to their Hands, equal, if not exceed ours in <hi>England:</hi> If we have more of the Woollen, they have more of Linnen and Silk. It was once a received opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on amongst them, that the use of Callicoes did prejudice their Linnen Manufacture, and therefore they Prohibited the use of it in <hi>Holland</hi> (they were not so quick sighted as our Essayer to see that it did affect the Woollen.) This gave advantage to our English <hi>East-India</hi> Company, that <hi>England</hi> at that time had the whole Trade for Callicoes: The Dutch are an Ingenious people, and soon saw their Errour, and recalled their Placeat, but could never retrive the Trade: The English <hi>East-India</hi> Company kept that part of it to the time of this French War, that by Intestine Fewds and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign misfortunes, they have lost both it and themselves.</p>
            <p>The Prohibition of the use of these Commodities in <hi>England,</hi> will either settle this Noble Trade on the Scots, or divide it between them and the Dutch. The English Manufacture will be prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:186339:3"/> not advantaged thereby: It will advance the price at Home, and so lessen the Trade, but not augment the Sale; and render it unfit for a Forreign Market, because they may be supplied cheap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er elsewhere.</p>
            <p>We conclude with the Essayer, and Humbly pray the Wisdom of the Nation would undertake the Patronage of our Trade, and particularly this of the <hi>East: Indies;</hi> to settle it on its True Basis, to make it a real advantage to the Kingdom, which can never be effectually done, but by leaving it free to that Company, they in their Wisdom shall think fit to Establish, that every Commodity may shift for it self.</p>
